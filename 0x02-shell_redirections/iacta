but with Shakespeare the keenness of mind was applied not to abstruse 

or remote subjects but to human beings and their complete range of emotionsand conflicts.

Other writers have applied their keenness of mind in this way,

but Shakespeare is astonishingly clever with words and images,

so that hismental energy, when applied to intelligible human situations,

finds full and memorable expression, convincing and imaginatively stimulating.
